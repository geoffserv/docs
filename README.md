# docs

Various quick docs for things I've moved through a few times and keep having to Google along the way.

For example, [quickly setting up a Mac for python virtualenvs](https://github.com/geoffserv/docs/blob/master/guide_macox-python-devenv.md), [linking the dev directory up with a Github repo](https://github.com/geoffserv/docs/blob/master/guide_git.md), etc.
